## About this project

Laravel is a great framework, but what if we could smooth it's frontend experience? Don't get me wrong: Laravel Mix is AWESOME and I've been using it for years. But new tools are comming to this space and if we can be more productive with a faster tool, why not?

That's why I'm trying to find a good setup to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with Laravel. This is still a very early experimentation, but the hype is real.
